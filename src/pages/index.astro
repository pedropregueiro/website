					I build software and have spent the last few years doing it as a founder. I like turning
					ideas into things people can use, adjusting along the way, and learning from the people
					who use them.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-6">
					My background is rooted in <TechTooltip text="backend" tooltip="Python" /> development â€” building
					<TechTooltip text="APIs" tooltip="FastAPI, Flask" />, integrating with third-party
					services, and abstracting complex business logic into simpler interfaces. That's where
					I've always felt most at home.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-6">
					In the last couple of years, I've been doing a lot more <TechTooltip
						text="full-stack"
						tooltip="React, TypeScript, Next.js"
					/> development. Despite initial skepticism, I've come to appreciate how quickly you can spin up and scale react monorepos. That said, if I
					need to throw together a quick script or test something out, I'll still reach for Python
					first.
